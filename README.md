# Linear-Regression_R
This project investigates the relationship between income and 3 sociodemographic predictors (education, gender, age) in Italy using the European Values Study Wave 5 dataset (https://doi.org/10.4232/1.13897)

By means of EDA (three-way plots and tables) and a stepwise linear regression model, the following questions are answered:

1.	What is the relationship between education and income?
2.	Does it vary when age and gender are taken into account?

Results: 

1. In Italy the differences in income are significant across the educational levels.
2. The association between income and education does not vary between men and women, whereas it does based upon age that makes it
stronger (suppressor variable).
