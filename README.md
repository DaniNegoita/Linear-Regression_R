# Linear-Regression_R
This project investigates the relationship between income and 3 sociodemographic predictors (education, gender, age) in Italy using the European Values Study Wave 5 dataset (https://doi.org/10.4232/1.13897)

By means of EDA (three-way plots and tables) and a stepwise linear regression model, the following questions are answered:

1.	What is the relationship between education and income?
2.	Is this relationship any different once we take into account gender?
3.	Is the relationship between education and household income any different depending on a personâ€™s gender?

Results:
